# FintechStudy

In this report, we examine the Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database 2017, the most comprehensive data set available on how adults manage risk, save, borrow, and make payments. Over 150,000 persons in 144 economies—or more than 97 percent of the world’s population—were surveyed for the indicators in the 2017 Global Findex database. The entire non-institutionalized civilian population aged 15 and over is the target population. We can further access the specifics of each variable in the data set at: "[Overview of dataset](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3324)".

We focused our research for this report on figuring out whether gender affects who is most likely to have an account with a financial institution or not. In order to do this, we first carry out our descriptive analysis. The gender gap is then examined in relation to several other factors like regions, age, education etc.
